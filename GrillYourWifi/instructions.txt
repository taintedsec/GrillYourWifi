1. Requires Airodump-ng and GNU Macchanger
2. Requires PIP and pandas for Python2.7
3. Initial command 'airodump-ng -w demodump --output-format csv --write-interval 1 wlan0'
4. Let the script run for about 15 seconds
5. Use Pandas to sort the first column BSSID into a Python2.7 list object
6. Sort through the list and remove words that contain no numerals
7. Sort throught the list to remove duplicate BSSID's
8. Use a forloop to iterate through each BSSID and spoof the corrective NIC to the BSSID
   of the first iterable string object in list, check to see if the iterable object has the
   same MAC address as the default NIC, if not throw an error, and continue
